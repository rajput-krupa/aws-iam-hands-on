# 🧑‍💻 Creating IAM Users

I created two users: `yashraj` and `alex` using the AWS Management Console.

## 🔽 Steps Followed
1. Went to IAM > Users > Add User
2. Gave both users **programmatic and console access**
3. Chose password settings and recorded temporary passwords
4. Added tags for identification
5. Skipped permissions (assigned later through group)
