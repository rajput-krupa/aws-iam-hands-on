# 🔐 Use Case 03 – Assigning Permissions to Group

After creating the `admin` group, I assigned the following permissions:



# ✅ Permissions Attached

# 1. `AdministratorAccess` (AWS Managed)
- Grants full access to all AWS resources
- Useful for administrative users
- Attached directly to the `admin` group

---

# 2. `IAMUserChangePassword` (Custom Policy)
- Allows users to change their own password
- Ensures better password security and self-management
